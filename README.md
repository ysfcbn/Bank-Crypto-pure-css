1- You can create as many accounts as you want. and you can check this all accounts movements and you can review all account activities of these accounts when typed "allUser" on the console screen, and you can watch all the process done instantly from the console.

2- You can create same "fullnamed" users but as you wish the passwords must be differently

3- This project  It has been created to respond to all possible user errors. create user error, login errors, blank fields, etc

4- If there are more than one users with the same name has been created and if another user except of these, want to send crypto currency one of them. The alert warning and IDs of the same named users  have been appeared in the screen and it is necessary to choose the ID number of user which you want to send the crypto currency.

5- If there are more than one users with the same name has been created and if one of them user send to crypto curency to other it will happen instantly, because they have diffent userIDs if there are more than two users with the same name and if one of them user send to crypto curency to other it will happen like fourth section alert, without current userID on the alert screen!

6- If you want to close the current account, just enter the correct fullname and password, when you confirm the account deletion, it will log out of the current account and delete the current account. and you can see deleted accounts by when typed "deletedUsersInfo" on the console screen, it keeps all account activity and user information before deletion
